# Textbased-mineSweeper
Minesweeper Clone Game
This is a text-based Minesweeper clone game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

**Game Description**
The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed.
To win, you need to open all the cells without hitting any mines.
The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe and cells that contain mines.
Interact, strategize, and enjoy the classic Minesweeper gameplay!

**How to Play**

Enter the size of the board (n x n, where n â‰¥ 9).
Enter the number of mines you want to place on the board.
The game will show the initial state of the board, and you can start playing.
Enter the coordinates (x, y) of the cell you want to open.
Avoid hitting a mine! If you hit a mine, the game ends, and you lose.
Keep opening cells until you have uncovered all non-mine cells to win the game.

**Gameplay Tips**

Use the numbers on the board to identify safe cells.
You can flag cells you suspect contain mines to help you strategize.
Be careful and plan your moves to avoid mines.
